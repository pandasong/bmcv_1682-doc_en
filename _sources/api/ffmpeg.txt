FFMPEG Interfaces
=================================

Customized FFMPEG software package is included in release package. 
It is developmed on opensource FFMPEG 4.1 version, main modification to it is to support BM1682 hardware video decoding accelerate. 

No modifications to fundermental video decoding application interface.

Parameter to indicating the PCIE board is added, it can be set when creating decoder context, 
to set the decoder hardware in the specific PCIE board:

    .. image:: ./ffmpeg1.png                                
       :width: 400px 
       :align: center

The parameter can be set before open decoder:
	
    .. image:: ./ffmpeg2.png                                
       :width: 400px 
       :align: center

Parameter is added to omit copy back of decoded frames to CPU:
	
    .. image:: ./ffmpeg3.png                                
       :width: 400px 
       :align: center
	
If the decoded frames are input to neuron network processing, 
by enable this parameter, the frames will not copy back to CPU, this can reduce data flow on PCIE interface: 
	
    .. image:: ./ffmpeg4.png                                
       :width: 400px 
       :align: center
	
Default frame format of VPU decode is NV12.
	
AVFrame structure is expanded, in which data array is enlarged to 8, the latter 4 holds physical address on PCIE board of the decoded color channels,
they are address within PCIE board and canâ€™t be accessed by CPU directly, they can be used as input to neuron network processing:

    .. image:: ./ffmpeg5.png                                
       :width: 400px 
       :align: center
