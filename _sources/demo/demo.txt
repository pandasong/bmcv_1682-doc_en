BMCV Sample Code Explain
============================

Short code fragment will be shown in this chapter to illustrate typical usage of bmcv application interface.

A BMDN context must be created for furture use, it will implement the compiled neuron network by BMCompiler, 
user can indicate which PCIE board to use in multi-board environment by parameter pcie_board_id:

.. image:: ./demo1.png                                
    :width: 400px 
    :align: center

Handle to the context can be accuired, using it as later neuron network processing and image/video accelerate: 

.. image:: ./demo2.png                                
    :width: 400px 
    :align: center

Neuron network objects are declared for furture operation:

.. image:: ./demo3.png                                
    :width: 400px 
    :align: center

Ffmpeg can be invoked to start decoding of the video stream, the same PCIE board on which neuron network context located is 
set to use the BM1682 VPU on that PCIE board: 

.. image:: ./demo4.png                                
    :width: 400px 
    :align: center

Parameter pcie_no_copyback can be enabled to reduce data transfer on PCIE interface.

.. code-block:: c

    Av_dict_set_int(&opts, “pcie_no_copyback”, 1, 0x0);

Start decoder, and get every frame of the video stream, construct memory description structure with the frame data address:

.. image:: ./demo5.png                                
    :width: 400px 
    :align: center

The memory description structure can be used as neuron network input, running in zero copy:

.. image:: ./demo6.png                                
    :width: 400px 
    :align: center
